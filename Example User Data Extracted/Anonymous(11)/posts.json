Every time I see him play or an interview of his, I learn something always.\nHis coolness, down to earth personality, being honest, giving his best whatever his does, being sarcastic when someone asks something irritating (the reporter who asks abt his retirement) :P analysing and planning well ahead (for the 2011 world cup), learning from failures and being positive (not being selected to the under 19 team), being an amazing leader, making them work together and bringing in the best in them\u2026the 20-20 world cup victory with such a young team, attributing the team's success to all the players :) and taking a failure on himself, his patriotism...one person who i have never seen play for himself but always for the country, for being so quick behind the wickets\u2026it's difficult to pick one, but the 1-run victory with Bangladesh in the 2016 world cup would be the best. Irrespective of how hectic ur profession is, give importance to ur passion (his love for bikes). His helicopter shots, his stumping, amazing catches and that amazing smile\u2026..an MSDian forever.\n\nLove you Mahi <3 :*", "id": "350405668489043_647573255438948"}, {"id": "350405668489043_646622942200646"}, {"id": "350405668489043_646621475534126"}, {"id": "350405668489043_641886212674319"}, {"id": "350405668489043_641678482695092"}, {"id": "350405668489043_641638396032434"}, {"message": ":p", "id": "350405668489043_637411846455089"}, {"id": "350405668489043_635491006647173"}, {"id": "350405668489043_144739892388956"}], "paging": {"previous": "https://graph.facebook.com/v2.4/350405668489043/posts?fields=with_tags,message,is_popular&since=1504975457&access_token=EAACEdEose0cBAIofFityZAtAb7CxTbtUORCsTAVCUvJYgwl3nNnOjdZB1mIUYZCO9LYYtZBvqBampqhV4vKf9yaXuXntefd8OqUrZB8Q8WeGVpNGrTIjCPQKCjyCaRx3T02IwAOhfMO3vqiKbFObqacIN59Ec0vsLpkzyFEMGLW5Ue9kG8YP1ZClAqHkZAZAeGcZD&limit=25&__paging_token=enc_AdCq4C9h9h2q7o6rU6Y0YCE2gfyfy2czuFDq42Gl7TPxt9O9dfz4duxKP1jzTa9YztxYJOvZBF4WZAckDVzTEZC30ZAYnykQCZB1B9EMw6cNuZCl0hzwZDZD&__previous=1", "next": "https://graph.facebook.com/v2.4/350405668489043/posts?fields=with_tags,message,is_popular&access_token=EAACEdEose0cBAIofFityZAtAb7CxTbtUORCsTAVCUvJYgwl3nNnOjdZB1mIUYZCO9LYYtZBvqBampqhV4vKf9yaXuXntefd8OqUrZB8Q8WeGVpNGrTIjCPQKCjyCaRx3T02IwAOhfMO3vqiKbFObqacIN59Ec0vsLpkzyFEMGLW5Ue9kG8YP1ZClAqHkZAZAeGcZD&limit=25&until=1496212200&__paging_token=enc_AdB4EmZCMJanOHKMZBJkU0p0Le5Ehn0tNd0cWdWEEK1qPZCVo3UQvlfS9BsVa6lkF2pXjS45Nf1ptFGF0z6D1YCulJA06KxcoqOzymya3fC5YK0ZBAZDZD"}}
