A particularly ambitious form of meditation aims at effortlessly sustained single-pointed concentration meant to enable its practitioner to enjoy an indestructible sense of well-being while engaging in any life activity.The word meditation carries different meanings in different contexts. Meditation has been practiced since antiquity as a component of numerous religious traditions and beliefs. Meditation often involves an internal effort to self-regulate the mind in some way. Meditation is often used to clear the mind and ease many health concerns, such as high blood pressure, depression, and anxiety. It may be done sitting, or in an active way\u2014for instance, Buddhist monks involve awareness in their day-to-day activities as a form of mind-training. Prayer beads or other ritual objects are commonly used during meditation in order to keep track of or remind the practitioner about some aspect of that training.", "id": "103750332997476"}, {"about": "The Vedas", "name": "Veda \"Knowledge\"", "category": "Community", "description": "The Vedas (Sanskrit \u0935\u0947\u0926\u093e\u0903 v\u00e9da, \"knowledge\") are a large body of texts originating in ancient India (complied around 1200 BC). Composed in Vedic Sanskrit, the texts constitute the oldest layer of Sanskrit literature and the oldest scriptures. The Vedas are apauru\u1e63eya (\"not of human agency\"). They are supposed to have been directly revealed, and thus are called \u015bruti (\"what is heard\"), distinguishing them from other texts, which are called sm\u1e5bti (\"what is remembered\").\nThe Vedic texts or \u015bruti are organized around four canonical collections of metrical material known as Sa\u1e43hit\u0101s, of which the first three are related to the performance of yajna (sacrifice) in historical Vedic religion:\n1.\tThe Rigveda, containing hymns to be recited by the hot\u1e5b;\n2.\tThe Yajurveda, containing formulas to be recited by the adhvaryu or officiating priest;\n3.\tThe Samaveda, containing formulas to be sung by the udg\u0101t\u1e5b.\n4.\tThe fourth is the Atharvaveda, a collection of spells and incantations, apotropaic charms and speculative hymns. \nThe individual verses contained in these compilations are known as mantras. Some selected Vedic mantras are still recited at prayers, religious functions and other auspicious occasions.\n", "id": "144809955642997"}], "paging": {"cursors": {"before": "NDk1Nzc3ODMzODM1NDkw", "after": "MTQ0ODA5OTU1NjQyOTk3"}, "next": "https://graph.facebook.com/v2.4/10201591850756613/likes?access_token=EAACEdEose0cBAIofFityZAtAb7CxTbtUORCsTAVCUvJYgwl3nNnOjdZB1mIUYZCO9LYYtZBvqBampqhV4vKf9yaXuXntefd8OqUrZB8Q8WeGVpNGrTIjCPQKCjyCaRx3T02IwAOhfMO3vqiKbFObqacIN59Ec0vsLpkzyFEMGLW5Ue9kG8YP1ZClAqHkZAZAeGcZD&fields=about%2Cname%2Ccategory%2Cdescription&limit=25&after=MTQ0ODA5OTU1NjQyOTk3"}}
