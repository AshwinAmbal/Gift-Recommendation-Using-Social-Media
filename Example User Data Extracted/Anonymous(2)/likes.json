Players breed rabbits with varying traits - the fittest rabbits survive and prosper.", "name": "Watership Darwin", "category": "Board Game", "description": "The game uses rabbits to teach Mendelian genetics and natural selection - with some incidental lessons on probability, biodiversity and the vicissitudes of life. The rabbits are made of 5 puzzle pieces, the features of which are determined by two Mendelian alleles. Players breed their rabbits using Punnet squares, and they get to use sexual selection to choose mates. The different traits allow the rabbits variable ability to obtain food and escape foxes. The fitness of traits depends on the environment - every player has a different environment. After several rounds of breeding and selection by starvation and predation, players will see that the rabbits in the different environments start to look different. \n\nFrom the game developer, Cara Boutte:\n\nI have been teaching my 7 and 9 year old nieces science lessons over Skype. I was trying to teach them the fundamental concepts of physics and chemistry with little experiments. But I'm a biologist, so I really wanted to teach them the fundamental concepts of biology. Biology only makes sense if you understand evolution and natural selection. Teaching biology without the concept of evolution is like teaching astronomy without the concept of gravity. So Jacob and I looked online for games that would teach kids about natural selection and evolution. There are games available, but I was APPALLED to see that many of them actually teach intelligent design, not natural selection, and other games are scientifically inaccurate. So I had no choice but to make up my own game. \n \nThe game I\u2019m developing is pretty much a rip-off of the biology and genetics that I've learned as a scientist - I've tried to hew to scientific principles as much as possible. This game is a work in progress. We\u2019ve gotten feedback from labmates, family and friends, and all these folks have made suggestions to make the game more fun and more educational. My guiding principle is that I want the game to be scientifically sound so it will be a good teaching tool. Sometimes there is tension between the game being scientifically valid and fun - but I think we\u2019re resolving this as well as possible! I hope more people can play the game and give suggestions for how to make it better!\n\nFrom business manager Jacob Fohtung:\n\nI\u2019m committed to helping others become entrepreneurs by converting their passions to real projects \n \nAs MLK Jr. said:\n \n\u201c For some strange reason, I can never be what I ought to be until you are what you ought to be. And you can never be what you ought to be until I am what I ought to be - this is the interrelated structure of reality.\u201d\n \nI saw Cara's vision of this project, Watership Darwin as a game changer in science teaching and I decided to become her ally (Business strategy and development expert) to get this game off the ground into the hands of kids across the US.\n \nWhile sitting next to Cara in lab (before I left to pursue my own passion in business), I got debriefings of her experiences giving science lessons to her 2 nieces on a weekly basis. I also saw her prepare for upcoming lessons, and we often discussed the best way to convey complex concepts to children.\n \nAs she mentioned earlier, she wanted to teach them the fundamentals of natural selection and genetics, and searched for a game to help her explain these concepts. Together we looked for games that were scientifically sound, but instead we found games that were based on intelligent design. With her inner entrepreneurial instincts and love of teaching, she decided to make a game to teach genetics and natural selection herself. I helped her test the game out with the PhDs and PhD candidates we worked with, so we could make sure the game follows the laws of nature as closely as possible, while still being fun!\n \nI have been very fortunate to contribute at the origin of this project, and I\u2019m excited to apply my business strategy and development experience to help get this amazing teaching tool into the hands of more kids.\n", "id": "1961004914131038"}, {"name": "Sayings said incorrectly", "category": "Amateur Sports Team", "id": "472162323134145"}, {"name": "21st Century Education", "category": "Education", "description": "Mission: To advance paths of self-learning\n\nWe aim to do this by: \n- Enabling a self-awareness that leads to purposeful educational decisions\n\n- Building a community that teaches each other and helps find relevant resources\n\n- Increasing the value of self-learning paths such they are recognized by companies and employers\n\n- Creating tools and services that will teach skills helpful in navigating real life situations", "id": "1899180787019834"}, {"name": "SF BAY AREA Student Housing", "category": "Real Estate", "id": "138008306273024"}, {"about": "Hebbar's Kitchen is all about Indian veg recipes.
